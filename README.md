# Themeagrams

## Overview

This is a Python word anagram game developed using the Pygame library. In this game, players need to unscramble anagrams to form valid words within a time limit. The game offers different themes, such as jungle, ocean, and cities, each with its own set of words.

## Features

- __Multiple themes:__ The game features three themes—jungle, ocean, and cities—each with a unique set of words for players to unscramble.
- __Time-based gameplay:__ Players have a limited amount of time to unscramble as many words as possible. The timer starts at 30 seconds and counts down.
- __Scoring:__ Players earn points for each correctly unscrambled word. The longer the word, the more points they earn.
- __Leaderboards:__ The game keeps track of the top scores for each theme and displays them on the leaderboard screen.
- __Player customization:__ Players can enter their name to be displayed on the leaderboard.
- __User-friendly interface:__ The game features a clean and intuitive interface with buttons for navigation.

## Installation and Requirements

Before running the game, you need to have Python and the Pygame library installed on your system.

1. __Python:__ Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from the official website: ***Python.org***.
2. __Pygame:__ Install the Pygame library using pip:
***pip install pygame***
3. __Images:__ Please download the three images: **city.jpeg**, **jungle.jpeg**, and **ocean.jpg**.
4. __Leaderboards:__ Please download the three leaderboards: **cities_leaderboard.txt**, **jungle_leaderboard.txt**, and **ocean_leaderboard.txt**.

## How to Play

1. Run the game by executing the Python script.
***python Themeagrams.py***
2. The game will start on the home screen, where you can choose to start playing, read the instructions, or view the leaderboards.
3. If you choose to play, select a theme (jungle, ocean, or cities), and you will be presented with an anagram to solve within a time limit.
4. Type your guess into the input box and press Enter to submit your answer. If your answer is correct, you'll earn points, and a new anagram will appear. If your answer is wrong, you can try again.
5. The game keeps track of your score and time remaining. Try to earn as many points as possible before the timer runs out.
6. When the game is over, you can enter your name (if you haven't already) to be added to the leaderboard.
7. You can navigate between screens using the on-screen buttons. The game features screens for the home, instructions, leaderboards, and game over.
